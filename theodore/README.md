## Theodore

Theodore is an emojiâ€‘friendly, contentâ€‘editable text input for React. It replaces native emoji characters with your own images so they render consistently across browsers.

- Consistent emoji rendering across platforms and browsers
- Bring your own emoji assets (e.g., Apple/Google/Twitter sets) and rendering
- Ctrl+Z works very well after inserting text or emoji

Try it in the playground: [Playground demo](https://playground.theodore-js.dev).

### Installation

```
npm install theodore-js
```

### Quick start

Below is a minimal example showing how to:

- Provide a `renderEmoji` function that maps a native emoji to your image asset
- Use a ref to call `insertEmoji` when an emoji is selected

```tsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';
import { Theodore, TheodoreHandle, useEditorState } from 'theodore-js';

const renderEmoji = (emoji: string) => {
  if (emoji === '') return <></>;
  const unified = nativeToUnified(emoji);
  const path = `/img-apple-64/${unified}.png`;
  return <img src={path} width={22} height={22} alt="emoji" />;
};

export const TheodoreTextInput: React.FC = () => {
  const theodoreRef = useRef<TheodoreHandle>(null);
  const editorState = useEditorState();

  const handleSelectEmoji = (emoji: { native: string }) => {
    theodoreRef.current?.insertEmoji(emoji.native);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Theodore
        ref={theodoreRef}
        editorState={editorState}
        renderEmoji={renderEmoji}
        placeholder="Write something..."
        maxLines={5}
      />
      {/* Your emoji picker should call handleSelectEmoji with a native emoji */}
      {/* <EmojiPicker onSelectEmoji={handleSelectEmoji} /> */}
    </>
  );
};
```

Notes:

- `renderEmoji` is required and tells Theodore how to render each emoji you type/paste.
- Theodore does not ship emoji images; point `renderEmoji` to your own assets.
- Emojis passed to `renderEmoji` and returned from your emoji picker are native characters (e.g., "ðŸ˜€"). If your assets are named using unified codepoints (e.g., `1f600`), convert native to unified yourself and map to your asset paths however you prefer. The example uses a `nativeToUnified(emoji)` helper for illustration; Theodore only provides the native string.
- Use the ref (`TheodoreHandle`) to programmatically insert emojis with `insertEmoji(native)`.

### Props

- **editorState (required, `EditorState`)**: The editor state returned by `useEditorState([onSelectionChange])`. Holds the tree, history, and selection. Create once and pass the same instance to `<Theodore />`.
- **renderEmoji (required, `RenderEmoji`)**: `(emoji: string) => ReactElement`. Receives a native emoji character and returns the React element to render (e.g., an `<img />`). Used whenever emojis are typed, pasted, or inserted programmatically.
- **placeholder (`string | React.ReactNode`)**: Content shown only when the editor is empty. If a string, it is wrapped in a styled placeholder container; if a React node, it is rendered as-is when empty.
- **className (`string`)**: Extra class for the contentEditable div.
- **wrapperClassName (`string`)**: Extra class for the contentEditable wrapper `div`.
- **placeholderClassName (`string`)**: Extra class applied to the placeholder element.
- **maxLines (`number`)**: Maximum visible line count before the editor scrolls.
- **onSelectionChange (`(selection: EditorSelection) => void`)**: Optional selection change callback. Provide it to `useEditorState(onSelectionChange)` when creating `editorState` to receive updates.
- **...div props**: All other `div` props (except `contentEditable`) are forwarded to the contentEditable element (e.g., `aria-*`, `data-*`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`).

### Converting to plain text

If you need the plain text representation of the editor state:

```tsx
import { convertTreeToText } from 'theodore-js';

const text = convertTreeToText(editorState.tree);
```

That will produce a string with the emoji characters restored.
