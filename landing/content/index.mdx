# Getting Started

Welcome to the Theodore.js documentation. This guide will help you set up Theodore in under five minutes.

## What is theodore-js?

Theodore-js is a lightweight, content-editable editor for React that gives you control over how emojis are rendered inside the input.
Use it when you need consistent emoji rendering across browsers, including support for custom emoji sets. Theodore also
preserves undo (Ctrl/Cmd + Z) behavior, which can otherwise break when using `contentEditable`.

## Installation

Install Theodore-js with one of the following commands:

import { Tabs } from 'nextra/components';

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install theodore-js
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add theodore-js
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    pnpm add theodore-js
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Theodore

Here’s a minimal setup to use Theodore in a React app:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Theodore, useEditorState } from 'theodore-js';
import 'theodore-js/style.css';

const renderEmoji = (emoji: string) => {
  if (emoji === '') return <></>;
  const unified = nativeToUnified(emoji);
  const path = `/img-apple-64/${unified}.png`;
  return <img src={path} width={22} height={22} alt={emoji} />;
};

export const TheodoreTextInput: React.FC = () => {
  const editorState = useEditorState();

  return (
      <Theodore
        editorState={editorState}
        renderEmoji={renderEmoji}
      />
  );
};
```
First, import the default styles from `'theodore-js/style.css'` so the editor, placeholder, and emoji
rendering styles are applied.

To render the editor, you only need to provide two props:

- **editorState (required, `EditorState`)**: Represents the current editor state (content, selection, and undo/redo history). You
  don’t need to manage its internals—just create one with the `useEditorState` hook and pass it in.
  If you want to be notified when the selection changes, pass an `onSelectionChange` callback to the
  `useEditorState` hook.

- **renderEmoji (required, `RenderEmoji`)**: A function Theodore calls whenever it needs to render an emoji. It receives the
  native emoji character and should return a `ReactNode` (typically an `<img />`) that Theodore will
  display in the editor. Returning something other than an image isn’t recommended, since it can
  affect editor behavior.


## Configuring Theodore

In addition to `editorState` and `renderEmoji`, you can pass these optional props to customize the editor experience:

- **placeholder (`string | React.ReactNode`)**: Content shown when the editor is empty. If you pass a string, Theodore renders it
  with the default placeholder styling/animation. If you pass a `ReactNode`, Theodore will render
  that instead.

- **placeholderClassName (`string`)**: If `placeholder` is a string, you can style it by providing a CSS class
  name here.

- **defaultDirection (`ltr` | `rtl`)**: The text direction to use when the editor is empty. Once the editor has
  content, direction is inferred from the content.

- **maxLines (`number`)**: The maximum number of lines the editor is allowed to grow to. If the user enters more
  lines, the editor becomes scrollable.

- **wrapperClassName (`string`)**: Use this to style the wrapper around the `contentEditable` element.

- **theodoreRef (`TheodoreHandle`)**: A ref/handle that exposes Theodore’s public API:
  - `setContent`: Sets the editor content programmatically (for example, to load an initial draft or
    replace the current content).
  - `insertEmoji`: Inserts an emoji string at the current selection. The same value you pass here is
    forwarded to `renderEmoji`, so make sure they match. This is typically used when inserting an
    emoji from an external UI (for example, an emoji picker).

- **shouldSuppressFocus (`boolean`)**: Mobile emoji panel helper. When true, the editor blurs on focus so the native keyboard does not open. This avoids showing both the system keyboard and your custom emoji panel at the same time.

- **ref (`HTMLDivElement`)**: Optional ref to the contentEditable div element.

- **...div props**: All other `div` props (except `contentEditable`) are forwarded to the contentEditable element (e.g., `aria-*`, `data-*`, `onFocus`, `onBlur`).
